## Purpose

* many new features (see NEWS)
* INSEE officially starts endorsing the package, as I have spent working hours developing the package INSEE should have copyright
* According to French law, software developed by a civil servant cannot be under GPL-2 license, so the package should move to GPL-3
* According to INSEE's internal guidelines, civil servants should contact CRAN team with an official  email address not a private one, that is why I would like to use hadrien.leclerc@insee.fr and drop my previous maintainer address (leclerc.hadrien@gmail.com)

## Test environments

* local Windows 7 x64, R version 3.6.3 
* Ubuntu 16.04 (travis), R : oldrel, release, devel

## R CMD check results
